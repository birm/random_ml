House Committee Favorably Reported,2020-03-02,"LC 34 5625 S. B. 396- 1 -Senate Bill 396By:  Senators Walker III of the 20th, Wilkinson of the 50th, Black of the 8th, Anderson ofthe 24th, Hill of the 4th and others AS PASSED SENATEA BILL TO BE ENTITLEDAN ACTTo amend Article 3 of Chapter 3 of Title 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to state symbols, so as to designate the pecan as the official state nut; to provide for related matters; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:4SECTION 1.5Article 3 of Chapter 3 of Title 50 of the Offici al Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to state symbols, is amended by adding a new Code section to read as follows: (a)(1)  The pecan is the only edible nut native to North America and is this country's most successful homegrown tree nut crop.  It is known for its health benefits; scientists have discovered that pecans' golden kernels are good for the heart, with antioxidants and cholesterol lowering effects.  The pecan traces its origins back to the 16th century, and12the name 'pecan' is derived from the Native Amer ican word 'pacane' that translates as 'nut requiring a stone to crack.'14(2)  The domestication of the pecan is attributed in large part to a Louisiana plantation slave known as Antoine, a master gardener who developed a method of grafting that led to the birth of the commercial pecan industry.  By 1920, Georgia was producing 2.5 million pounds of pecans; half a century later, the Georgia nut had grown so iconic that organizers for the 1996 Olympics crafted Muhammad Ali's torch handle out of pecan wood.  Pecans remained a local commodity for a long time, enjoyed mainly in the South, but global demand for them has skyrocketed  in the last decade, including the emerging marketplace in China where nuts are considered a delicacy.  In 2015, Georgia farmers produced 37 percent of pecans grown in the United States and, despite hurricanes and tariffs, Georgia continues to be regarded as the top pecan producing state, with over ,000 acres planted.25(3)  Pecans can be enjoyed raw, roasted, or flavored and can be incorporated into gourmet cooking through countless recipes, such as pecan pie, pralines, brittle, and candies. LC 34 5625 S. B. 396- 2 -Public recognition and demand for Georgia Grown branded products have increased significantly due in large part to the many Georgia Grown pecan growers and processors who promote this state's homegrown products and agritourism sites.  People throughout the nation and world associate Georgia with the pecan, and appropriate Georgia recognition of pecans will help promote tourism in the state. (b)  The pecan is designated as the official Georgia state nut.33SECTION 2.34All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.35"

Writing in an Atlanta newspaper, former Confederate President Alexander H. Stephens urged clemency; and WHEREAS, Susan Eberhart maintained her innocence throughout her arrest, incarceration, trial and hanging; and33WHEREAS, numerous mitigating circumstances were not taken into account at the trial of Susan Eberhart, especially as her statements indicated that she was not sensible of the moral and legal guilt of murder and the circumstances of being placed in a subservient position with her employer, Enoch Spann; and WHEREAS, for months prior to the date  of execution, the governor and the prison board were besieged with appeals to spare Susan Eberhart's life from essentially all over the United States and especially from the citizens of Georgia.

Smith), sometimes called ""iron fisted"" against a request for pardon or commutation, ended his communication to the numerous appeals both locally and nationally by responding that all applications on behalf of Miss Eberhart have been considered and decided against her; Smith's refusal to pardon Susan Eberhart cost him his reelection, and he was never reelected to any other position.  Obviously, the will of the people was not served; and48WHEREAS, the conviction and execution of Su san Eberhart was called by one newspaper49of the time, ""a disgrace to the age and a repro ach to the state.""

Professionalism was, and still is, closely linked to European features and mannerisms, which entails that those who do not naturally fall into Eurocentric norms must alter their appearances, sometimes drastically and permanently, in order to be deemed professional; (3)  Despite the great strides American society and laws have made to reverse the racist ideology that Black traits are inferior, hair remains a rampant source of racial discrimination with serious economic and health consequences, especially for Black individuals;23(4)  Workplace dress code and grooming polic ies that prohibit natural hair, including afros, braids, twists, and locks, have a disparate impact on Black individuals as these LC 50 0005 S. B. 286- 2 -policies are more likely to deter Black applicants and burden or punish Black employees than any other group;27(5)  Federal courts accept that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, and therefore protects against discrimination against afros. However, the courts do not understand that afros are not the only natural presentation of Black hair.  Black hair can also be naturally presented in braids, twists, and locks;31(6)  In a society in which hair has historically been one of many determining factors of an individual's race, and whether that individual was a second class citizen, hair today remains a proxy for race.  Therefore, hair discrimination targeting hairstyles associated with race is racial discrimination; and (7)  Acting in accordance with the constitutional values of fairness, equity, and opportunity for all, the General Assembly recognizes that continuing to enforce a Eurocentric image of professionalism thr ough purportedly race-neutral grooming policies38that disparately impact Black individuals and exclude them from some workplaces is in direct opposition to equity and opportunity for all.40SECTION 2.41Code Section 8-3-201 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to definitions relative to fair housing, is amended by adding ne w paragraphs and revising paragraphs (13), (14), and (15) as follows:44(13)  'Protective hairstyles' includes, but is  not limited to, such hairstyles as braids, locks, and twists.46(14)  'Race' includes traits historically associated with race, including, but not limited to, hair texture and protective hairstyles.48(13)(15)  'Respondent' means: (A)  The person or other entity or the state or local government or agency accused in a complaint of an unfair housing practice; and (B)  Any other person or entity identified in  the course of an investigation and notified as required with respect to respondents so identified under subsection (d) of Code Section 8-3-207.54(14)(16)  'State' means the State of Georgia.

(2)  'Protective hairstyle' means braids, locks, twists, or other textured hairdressing historically associated with an individual's race. (b)  No employer shall fail or refuse to hire nor shall any employer discharge or discriminate against any individual with respect to wages, rates of pay, hours, or other terms and conditions of employment because of such individual's protective hairstyle unless such protective hairstyle restricts such individual's ability to engage in the particular job or occupation for which he or she is eligible.83(c)  Any individual who is aggrieved by an alleged violation of this Code section may institute a civil action against the persons engaged in such alleged violation.  Such action may be maintained in any court of competent jurisdiction and shall be commenced no later than one year after the alleged violation occurred.

SB 2/AP S. B. 2- 8 -SECTION 4.242Said chapter is further amended by adding a new Code section to read as follows: (a)  The General Assembly finds that electric membership corporations providing broadband services should be permitted to use existing electric easements to provide or expand access to broadband services.  The General Assembly also finds that utilizing existing electric easements to provide broadband services, without the placement of additional poles or other ground based structures, does not change the physical use of the easement, interfere with or impair any vested rights of the owner or occupier of the real property subject to the electric easement,  or place any additional burden on the property interests of such owner or occupier.  Consequently, the installation and operation of broadband services within any electric easement are merely changes in the manner or degree of the granted use as appropriate to accommodate a new technology and, absent any applicable express prohibition contained in the instrument conveying or granting the electric easement, shall be deemed as a matter of law to be a permitted use within the scope of every electric easement. (b)  Subject to compliance with any express prohibitions in an electric easement, the owner of an electric easement may use an electric easement to install, maintain, lease, and operate broadband services without incurring liability to the owner or occupant of the real property subject to the electric easement or paying additional compensation to the owner or occupant of the real property subject to the  electric easement, so long as no additional poles or other ground based structures are installed; provided, however, that any electric utility owning an electric easement may assess fees and charges and impose reasonable conditions on the use of its facilities within an el ectric easement for the purpose of providing or supporting broadband services.266SECTION 5.267This Act shall become effective upon its appr oval by the Governor or upon its becoming law without such approval.269SECTION 6.270All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed. 271"
