WHEREAS, the Child Citizenship Act of  aimed to provide equal treatment under United States law for adopted and biological children by granting citizenship to internationally-born adoptees or children adopted by United States citizens.  However, when the act became law, it did not apply to internationally-born adoptees who were already over the age of 18; and7WHEREAS, an estimated tens of thousands of adult legal adoptees of U.S. citizens who were born before February 27, 1982, and raised in the  United States, and in particular, Georgia are still undocumented, and therefore potentially subj ect to possible deportation. These adoptees' parents did not complete necessary processes to provide their adopted children with citizenship, or in many cases, even a green card; and WHEREAS, several deportations of individuals who were legally adopted by U.S. citizens have already taken place, breaking up families and returning the deported individuals to places where they were born but have no family, language ability, or a means to support, placing themselves at risk of homelessness, poverty, and death; and WHEREAS, adoptees who do not have citizenship have come from countries throughout the world including Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany, Guatemala, El Salvador, Haiti, India, Iran, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Panama, Philippines, Russia, Taiwan, Ukraine, and Vietnam.  There are approximately 18,000 Korean American adoptees alone whose citizenship has not yet been confirmed despite being legally adopted by U.S. citizens; and22WHEREAS, bipartisan legislation, the Adoptee Citizenship Act, was introduced in the 114th and 115th Congresses, and will be introduced in the 116th Congress to close a loophole in24 19LC 119 0147 H.

Citizenship would be granted to any individual who was adopted by a U.S. citizen before age , including kinship adoptions, was physically pr esent in the United St ates in the citizen parent's legal custody pursuant to a lawful admission before the individual reached age 18, never previously acquired U.S. citizenship, a nd was lawfully residing in the United States;33and34WHEREAS, naturalization of adult adoptees who immigrated to America under the promise of finding a permanent home is necessary to en sure they are not forcibly removed from what has become their home country; and WHEREAS, Georgia does not condone the deportation of individuals who were legally adopted into American homes and should ha ve every expectation that their citizenship matches that of their adoptive parents.  Further, Georgia welcomes broad legislation that will provide a pathway to citizenship for all adult adoptees whose adoptive parents did not complete the naturalization process while they were children. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that the members of this body urge the President of the United States and the United States Congress to enact legislation securing the citizenship of internationally adopted adult individuals.46BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Clerk of the House of Representatives is authorized and directed to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the President of the United States and to each member of Congress.
